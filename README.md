# Disregard that, I'm an asshole

A passive aggressive emoji filtering system for online slack communications.

Are you sick of passive aggressive emojis peppering your otherwise ruthlessly formal and 
professional work environment? Are you not above fighting fire with fire?

This handy dandy plugin will perform advanced sentiment analysis on all messages that 
happen to pass into your field of vision during your everyday slack activity, and replace
that which is subltly smug and conceited with something more overtly ridiculous.

A very petty way of reducing the smug cloud density in your life.
